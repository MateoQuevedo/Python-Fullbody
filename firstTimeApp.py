## If you want to save the CSV file in the same directory as the current Python script or Jupyter Notebook, you can use the __file__ attribute to get the path of the current script, and then manipulate it to create the file path for the CSV file
## In this example, the os module is used to work with file paths. The os.path.abspath(__file__) function gives the absolute path of the current script, and os.path.dirname() extracts the directory path. Then, os.path.join() is used to combine the directory and file name to create the final file path for the CSV file.
